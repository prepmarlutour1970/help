**How to Repair PEX Plumbing** efficiently starts with identifying leaks using pressure tests or visual inspection. The flexibility and durability of PEX tubing make repairs straightforwardâ€”often requiring just a few fittings and crimp rings. Costs depend on material quality, labor (typically $100â€“$300 for minor fixes), and accessibility. Steps include: shutting off water, cutting damaged sections, installing new PEX with a crimping tool, and pressure-testing. Unlike rigid pipes, PEX allows faster, low-waste repairs, saving time and money. Always consult a pro for complex issues to ensure a leak-free, long-lasting fix.
